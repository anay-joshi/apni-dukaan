# Apni-Dukaan

## Summary

• Full Stack E-commerce web application with services including Email-Activation & Braintree’s Payment Gateway.
<br>
• Incorporated RESTful layer of APIs using Django REST framework to minimize server latency. 
<br>
• Consumed REST API (tested using Postman) to render out data in React front end.

## Motivation
I developed a keen interest in making things work using python. So, I started learning django for web developmet. In my opinion, project-based learning is the best way to get started.
<br>
So, I started working on an actual problem statement for a local vendor.
Till now, I have learnt few concepts of django. And so, this project is in development stage.

## Build status
Rest API for handling backend is ready and tested. Currently working on React front end to consume that API.
