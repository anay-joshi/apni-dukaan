# Apni-Dukaan

Apni Dukan is E-commerce website that I am developing for a local clothing store.

## Motivation
I developed a keen interest in making things work using python. So, I started learning django for web developmet. In my opinion, project-based learning is the best way to get started.

So, I started working on an actual problem statement for a local vendor.
Till now, I have learnt few concepts of django. And so, this project is in development stage.

## Build status
